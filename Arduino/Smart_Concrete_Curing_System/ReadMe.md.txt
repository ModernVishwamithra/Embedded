Smart Concrete Curing System
In the present era, water scarcity is the biggest problem. In Construction potable water
is required for mixing and curing of concrete. The curing process is required for 28 days. So the
water requirement in the construction field for curing purposes is very large. Due to various
reasons, potable water availability is decreasing day by day. So it is required to spend a
considerable amount on the procurement of water. To control the wastage of water for curing it is
necessary to use water in a controlled manner by adopting advanced technology. It is known as a
smart concrete curing system. The smart concrete curing system is developed to create an
automatic curing mechanism to supply water for curing depending on the availability of moisture
in the concrete and surrounding temperature using moisture sensor. The system will be connected
to the internet using Wi-Fi. The current moisture content level of the concrete structure and the
pump status will be pushed to the cloud. A mobile app will access this data from the cloud. So
that the curing process monitoring can be done remotely. Results shown that strength of the cube
with smart concrete curing system is more than the strength of the cube with immersion curing.
